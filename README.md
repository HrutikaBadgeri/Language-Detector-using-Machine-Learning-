# Language-Detector-using-Machine-Learning-

In natural language processing, language detection determines which natural language the given content is in. Computational approaches to
this problem view it as a special case of text categorization, solved with
various statistical methods.
This project implements a language detection software/tool using python and machine learning. This model is being used to detect language of the given input text, the predicted output is categorical in
nature and holds 17 different values i.e it can classify 17 different languages accurately.
